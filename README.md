| Database | MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose       | Flexible document model with schema validation                    |
| Auth     | JWT in `httpOnly` cookies      | Safer token storage than `localStorage`                           |
| State    | React Context                  | Simple shared state for auth and tasks without Redux overhead     |
| Hosting  | Vercel + Render                | Easy frontend/backend deployment for internship projects          |

## ⚙️ Running Locally

### 1) Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd TaskManager
```

### 2) Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Create `backend/.env` with:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

These values are for local development. For deployment, use the live frontend and backend URLs instead of `localhost`.

### 3) Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Create `frontend/.env` with:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

This is the local API URL. In production, point `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed backend URL.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Auth Routes

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                                 | Auth Required |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user and set auth cookie     | No            |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`    | Log in an existing user and set auth cookie | No            |
| POST   | `/api/auth/logout`   | Clear the auth cookie                       | No            |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me`       | Get the currently authenticated user        | Yes           |

### Task Routes

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                      | Auth Required |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| GET    | `/api/tasks`     | Get tasks for the logged-in user | Yes           |
| POST   | `/api/tasks`     | Create a new task                | Yes           |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/:id` | Update an existing task          | Yes           |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/:id` | Delete a task                    | Yes           |

## 🧠 Assumptions & Technical Decisions

I used `httpOnly` cookies for authentication instead of `localStorage` because cookies are not readable by JavaScript, which reduces token theft risk in XSS scenarios. That makes the auth flow safer for a production-style internship project while still keeping implementation straightforward.

MongoDB + Mongoose fits this app because task data is naturally document-shaped and the schema requirements are simple. Mongoose still gives validation, defaults, and a clean model layer without forcing a relational design that the project does not need.

React Context was a better fit than Redux because the app only needs shared auth and task state. Context keeps the codebase lighter, easier to review, and easier to explain in an assignment setting without adding Redux boilerplate.

Vite was chosen over Create React App because it starts faster, bundles faster, and gives a smoother development experience. For a modern React 18 app, Vite is the more practical default.

Separate `AuthContext` and `TaskContext` keep concerns isolated. Authentication state changes for login/register/logout should not be mixed with task fetching and mutations, so splitting them makes the app easier to maintain and debug.

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs

| Feature         | Decision                   | What I'd do in production                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drag-and-drop   | Deferred for current scope | Add `@dnd-kit/core` with accessible keyboard support            |
| Search / filter | Deferred for current scope | Add debounced search, status filters, and server-side filtering |
| Pagination      | Deferred for current scope | Add cursor-based pagination when task volume grows              |
| Refresh tokens  | Deferred for current scope | Add refresh token rotation and session revocation               |
| Testing         | Minimal                    | Add unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage                  |

## 🔒 Security Measures

- Passwords are hashed with `bcrypt`
- Auth token is stored in an `httpOnly` cookie
- Rate limiting protects login and register endpoints
- `helmet` adds basic HTTP security headers
- CORS is restricted to the frontend origin
- Task ownership checks prevent users from editing other users' tasks

Built as part of an internship assignment.
